Blobscanner is a small lightweight library for the Processing Programming Environment which can be used for blob detection and analysis in images and videos. It performs quite well, also, when the signal analyzed is a live stream. Please refer to the project [blog](http://sites.google.com/site/blobscanner/blog) for information about the status of this project.
In the following image is visible an example of hand tracking using Blobscanner in conjunction with a skin detector algorithm. The hand center of mass can be easily computed with Blobscanner.

In [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPWZ5qERSII) video, Blobscanner is used to create a simple artistic effect on  a web cam video stream.
